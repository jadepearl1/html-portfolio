<p>LOTR author, JRR Tolkein has set the bar for modern fantasy with these books. The movie
    adaptations by Peter Jackson were cinematic masterpieces!

<p>Absolutely hilarious comedy about a fashionista out of Bel-Air who went to law school on
    a whim to get her boyfriend back. Turned into a good story about female empowerment.
