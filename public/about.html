<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Jade Pearl. I grew up in a small town in Maryland, USA. I absolutely love geek culture and am an
  aspiring video game developer. I love playing video games, watching movies/TV shows with loved ones, playing
  tabletop RPG or other tabletop games. D&D is one I really enjoy playing with friends. I also enjoy spending
  some time doing solo journaling RPG's, one I really like being Thousand Year Old Vampire.
</p>

<p>I have much love for my partner, Shawn Marvel, who has always been there to make me laugh and feel comfortable
  being myself. We will be getting married in October of 2024.
</p>

<p>Outside of pop culture, I love to sing, draw, crochet, and spend time with my beloved pets! All cats and dogs
  are welcome around me!
